teenage mix of arrogance and insecurity
willing to forgive him 1k sins for that punch
zzz thought he was gonna be cool chairman
idk if he was laying his own life down it'd be one thing but it's your dad's ahhhh
like his actions were just not well thought out idk
drinking
living proudly in the face of economic pressure
what's the difference between flexing like an asshole and enjoying nice things
college and do well good advice or pressure on kid?
chairman a kinda mixed character? nope just bad
awww running
ok but it's just a 10 minute mile lol also can't you take a bus guess not
did you do well?
i mean you can be honest with people without calling them twisted lol
sympathy = looking down on people
she's cool
lol they're so awkward i like it
man i hope the father and girl have nothing but good things happen to them
him too
AHHHHH of course he gets hit man
"as long as we're alive" and that ok kdramas hit where it hurts
of course it's that fucker this is a kdrama
this isn't good for anyone though but if you're gonna do it just manslaughter it properly
does he do it do i want him to do it wtf

2

she's 1v9 wtf not understand how you feel but know what your dad would say
oppa...
fucked up kid is kinda dad's fault
makes you wanna go vegetarian

asshole in sweater now but i guess he's not the biggest asshole here?
wtf is his laugh
police fked too
why is everyone here a jerk
tell her she did nothing wrong
money funny or serious or what
rich = revenge? at least something drives him
being a man
are you doing well?
we'll she's grown up
yeah go to hongdae
gay and black guys wtf itaewon is hopping or what
price of dad's life is deep sea fishing??
i'm not rich yet - what does it mean
edgy presentation lol

her teacher is nice
ok but did nothing really happen in 7(/2) years
did he age?
love in the face of financial instability
ok but does he have to make 200 million won every year or what

3
so phones are the dif
she's kinda 1v9
she's kinda 1v10
don't you know you're being recorded wtf
mobile app ofc hookup
wtf can chairmen in korea get away with slapping people or no
funny motorcycle scene
sajangnim = sir?
ok but can there not be 2 pubs in a hopping district
she didn't choose him she chose not murder wtf
the hospital bill only a slight issue must not be america
nice they don't go straight to the pub
like misaeng, workplace drama, sociopath infested
her mom kinda fked but w/e
no. 1
jealousy always moves it forwards
so sad
chairman jang has lessons?
did he compromise his principles by letting the underage kids in
it would be weird if she didn't change at all in 7 yrs tho but why unprompted and did he know
this thing is so painful the struggle
can't watch
ofc that was his brother what a small world
rly can't watch good ppl struggling
his dad's laugh

behind every great fortune you will find a crime 
The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly executed

cant watch is what intro/stills are for

business founder attitude

4
these kids suck at running btw
mannn encourage the non moron or something idk
cool itaewon district blue hair gender neutral looks
baduk always a metaphor for business or what
ms kang could be good idk
they really skipping months and years
kakaotalk!
is it american psycho but korean girl or what
she could just stay in the crowds?
cheek is swollen but it isnt lol
rooting for psycho and him fk orphan girl but i do like to see them run together
nice girl talk altho it is about a guy
she feels bad tho
ok
just dissapointed
weird thing btw where obviously starting a fight is bad but the showmakers want them to respond to a fight
WHY DID SHE CALL THE POLICE BTW
atone for your sins with pushups
lol is it she's presenting male
danbam = sweet night
get drunk and spill your heart is a good way
ok the kissing the unconscious person would be a bit weird with gender reversed no
all the parents her mom is meh tho
you know as soon as you flip the coin anyways
"he's not just a mediocre man i will turn him into something amazing" ok

5
a bit of blood on the lip (not on knuckles)
rooting for bastard
cmon I thought it'd at least taste good
so is she just gonna run the whole place or what
ok but just lay off the guy you just hired
i mean she's kinda 1v9 manager
chaebols must really consolidate through marriage
wearing a mask pre corona
FIGHTING
life is good
manager is 1v99
ignoring him is the best thing she can do
the band of misfits
manager 1v9 on clubbing too
ahhh clubbing omg does everyone actually watch this i cant omg
rofl trans "does thatmean you still have a" this is a kdrama or what "hey bro. hey sis"
is there really no better way
it's just business
mad when she calls boss a pushover
slap
slap
ok maybe slaps going a bit far also now she wants to slap soo ah
wtf she said it was a wrong number that's kind of ah soap opera twist
you should guide hyun yi so we won't suffer a loss
they were saying him now he says give her honest feedback
she should be the judge on a cooking show
prettier with black hair sis omg
"i trusted you too" so corny you can see it coming but still a good scene
i feel like they could've made more tension by showing financial statements or numbers idk
but she didn't make the call in the end
the supporting characters can leave now tho lol
painful relationshup with soo ah ahhhh
rofl sound effect

kinda thought she'd be assigned female presenting male tbh

6
he turned out pretty well for not being loved by anyone
she doesnt want pity
cherish and love yourself is fine but you can express yourself more clearly
why is she going to the dinner on purpose wtf stop
can food mend all wounds
she is honest
kinda declaring war in front of your enemy and asking them to drink with you
i mean why would you even go to that dinner
psycho girl just knows everything
lol he's traumatized by chicken
soo ah is also honest
20% of net she has the founder attitude too
kronika more like "so what" instead of "thats what i dont get"
im smart and clever. i can achieve both love and success. i mean is that how to tell it to your mom
good she can say im living my life though
because I need you awwwwwww
lol does the black guy even speak english like what if he's just korean
living your life to the fullest doesnt mean just being a jangga employee
at least she's telling him he shouldn't like her
he's so obnoxious
she didn't say they'd be on?
roof contemplation
if you tell him to cut you out of his life (which you should) you can't be mad when he does
"I feel like I"m playing Go with a handicap"
no handicap
why does she have to work for jangga tho
he just made 1.6 million dollars in 10 years??? in manual labor or what, hedge fund friend must be broken
jang kinda created se ri yo
are they telepathic or what

7
soft tofu stew product placement?
normal is flawless (as can be)
he slurpsssss his food
the showdown goes about how it goes
kronika - i know?
save the swallow, get rewards
well you are right is a good reaction
nice clenching/hair mannerisms
university by going through hell
revenge is a motivator for sure
a little twisted = hedge fund manager :D
nam park saeroyi
Hankuk University of Foreign Studies
are they ousting the chairman or what
is she the orphanage lady from one of the first scenes
capitalism
now this is what they call 17d checkers
is she joining hands for real
I'm worried about the company after I die
bula idk bulaaaaa i really dont know
the chairman is sophisticated? but very basic in competition in a way
the son rejecting his father's life <3 <3 <3
i thought the small fishbowl was the douchebag son not going out on his own i guess that's what they think of own resteraunts
yup he's just korean lol
does every korean girl say to take over jangga co to win their heart or what
the toddler is a low blow
de sajangnim = "yes boss" not "sure"?
police officer is rough
backstory or tenderness or something nice motivated love
kinda cliche but nice still that he black guy beats her in mental math
capitalism and rents...

can he beat the chairman without becoming the chairman

8
she said ahjussi? idk if should be translated as father
can he not just buy a building
you took absolutely nothing from me
he's not discouraged and also he got a badass new coat
clubbing cute
I hope they don't make psycho and proud fight
someone to lean on awwwww
and it's not pity
how is he so wholesome still and is psycho just racist on purpose or what
psycho shouldn't have let puppy go?
orphan girl has a good point that doing it his way is what she's not willing to understand herself
idk at least good of her to clarify she loves him
orphan kinda gave psycho the life she couldnt
ofc it was her from earlier and it comes back
ms kang what happens theres no way she doesnt either double cross or get caught i hope it's not the former or either ahh
just leave janga orphan lady ahhh
it's a fake there's no way she's leaving him

9
she looks like a good streamer
she's thinking ahead with the chairman right
don't let this guy in a car
cute chat. ofc he come up with name (episode 9 btw)
did anything happen to the daughter
phew
selling her dad or what
"children follow in their parents footseps" twist the knife or what
like she was just misdirecting him and buying time right
fighting!

the funny thing about kdramas is they never have sex explicitly so like a trans character could be kinda easy to pull off
the neighborhood tide revitalizes the whole alley
she is the compromise the dreamer/idealist means
all the quotes flashbacks juxtapositions
rooftop scene? or bridge?
quitting threat - should just communicate with each other
"do you not know" ahhh
he's not gonna sell his soul to jangga chairman twice lol
hajeman = but?
ok but he has thought about his child
ONE PATHETIC FOOTSTEP IS ENOUGH
nice touch black korean talking about how koreans are loyal and faithful
she has to be faking
did she poison him or what
oh she just records things thank god
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA GET SHIT ONN

10
itaewon can do better?
come on itaewon
blood on the lip btw
rub hair down, pat shoulder (hug?)
these blows are so obviously fake tho lol
but it's fine because the dad is so convincingly twisted and so is the son now too
what game is ms kang playing
chairman jang has to do something really brutal here or he's done
can he not catch her running or what like I guess in general they let their kids out more but still
give ms kang the kid?
just 12% ? lol
ok but does soo ah not realize the dad is at fault in the long run or what
you could get food for your family without all this stuff
the way he's committed to products being delicious is a thing
kang and soo ah are in on it!
bully isn't helping anyone's case lol
ohhhhhh she's cold
the company will take care of it wow
blood is thicker than water? lol "water is thicker than blood" they straight up messed up the translations
viki translates music too
https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/fbgeyf/netflix_subtitles/
whatever they say he's still your dad <- how is that helpful
prioritizing self idk
chairman jang hugs his son... too late tho no?
rubbing it in right after they hug
"didnt discipline" i mean just give him a hug before you're about to die
chairman jang makes his move
he kneels
does he turn on the father or no ahhh is the one hug helpful or no
she said sajangnim not chairman jang?
soju
SPICY PORK WITH GOCHUJANG (but obviously developed by father park)
truth amidst the 1997 IMF financial crisis
ofc the watch was the gift lol
director kang: i bet you'll be a lot better than me
soju head tilt (tears) it'll be bitter until you go back to your pub imo :(

part of choosing your own happiness is being with good people (like saeroyi) @that guy

11
his dad's laugh
gu rae = good?
ok toni curry powder the soup
ma hyun yi!!
he's not actually happy with second tho?
number 1
imagine going from saeroyi to chairman jang
orphan girl kinda fked up from jangga
ofc loan lady turns out to be his grandmother
awwww he's such a nice boss/guy
good that miss kang mentoring him still
can they even use 10 billion won
happy to see psycho bouncing though
so he's still jogging as a hobby even with al the phones ringing ok
sajangnim also ma'am
old lady kinda mean
old lady kinda racist
car accident or suicide
yea grandson should kinda hate her no?
so orphan found out the mission and told wedlock but he doesn't tell her
gotta try soft tofu stew i guess
lol if you copy your father youre just gonna make chef leave not pressure him? orphan isnt a good influence either
stop liking soo ah please idk it's good they're honest but this is not what i wanna hear
SFUDSUFDFUSHUHDSUHDSUHU NO?? that's devastating
go kiss her
too much soju not enough food
listen to hyun yi not wedlock don't let her cry alone
yes hyun yi tell wedlock someone still cares about being a good person around here
sarangyeo sajangnim
don't tell her she's mistaken
she kinda fked up with wedlock but she's better now and it's fked if he's not honest about it
but like idk i guess we're supposed to root for psycho over orphan how can he not i guess idk

adela hair (and brain) btw

12
hyun in 1v9 good person or what
she can say "you seem quite different now from when you were at danbam" but only guide others to a advice she can't take herself
it was a plot omg and it turned out he was right about slowing opening ahh
although he could've said what his concern was if that was it
he sees it but he had her carry the plant
he's 1v9 if he carries the speech on the taste of the food
scars collected all their lives
how can she say "what about me" like you can just leave chairman jang?
like she can do what she wants but so can he
low point for sure
YES
TELL HER
just tell her she's the bad person here
the old lady yesss there are good capitalists
ms kim invested in jangga??
a referendum on his life or something
aigo tch tch
just resign hand it in
saeroyi is not the same as your dad lol he said he cares about his goal not your feelings but he doesn't step on other ppl
it's not something you give and take but i still like you (nicer if it turns out right in the end but that undermines it)
ms kim and ms kang are the good capitalists
chestnut and wildcat
yeah he can be hardheaded
if he outs her as trans there's no forgiveness for wedlock
like there's good pride and bad pride just take the investment from ms kim
regardless of revenge you can be happy with danbam and its people
chestnut needs wildcat to go to the place and stuff
she's a girl because she shouts about her emotions at first and cries instead of holding it in 
OK FUCK WEDLOCK
a bathroom scene too itaewon class goes for the jugular
have him kiss her like agnes (or whatever garfinkel was) but good
it was the hyun yi show all along
"nature"
OPEN THOSE DOORS

13
pressure the diamond
im shaking just watching her but how is she not shaking
for saeroyi, you, and the danbam family
i will toughen up, i will stay strong
hyun yi is the anime hero
I don't need anyone's approval or validation
repay the people who make me strong by making delicious food
just say hyun yi already pleeeeeeaaaase
60 seconds how can they do this
holy shit pleaFDUHSDFIUHFSGDIUDFSUYDS FUFIDSHUI UIHEWFUI UEWU EWIU IOIO EIOFJI UFHSIUUDSFudsFHFSDHUI SDFHUIDFIUDSUFHSDUIFHIU DSUIHF IUDSFHUIHDSF UDSFUHI DSFHIUUHIDSFUIHSDFIUHDSFIUDSFUIFSDUHDFSIUHDSFIUHDSFIUDS FHIDIUFSH UIDSFHIUSDFHUI DSFUIHDSFUHIDSFUIHDSFUIHUIHSDFUIDHSFUHISDFUIHSFDUHISFDUHIFDSUHIDSFUIHDSFUHDSFIUHIDSFUIHDSFIUH
HYUN YI IS SO AMAZING
the song's name is stone (diamond) btw
wedlock starting to look like bully
there are no bad apples
wildcat say you're sorry but fuck you. but don't blame this on her it was your fault wedlock
"sajangnim sajangnim sajangnim" -> "again! I'm so sick of hearing you talk about him"
you can stop jangga tho
and she says i'm sorry i can't accept that's right by her
do they even sleep or do they just walk around scenic spots (bridges, rooftops) all the time
more a long movie than a show doing a lot of things
she goes with him even though he doesn't pet her hair
wedlock looks like bully sort of painful and unhappy
ok they do need sleep after all lol
awww dad proud of him
he made like 875,000 usd from nothing on fishing boats?
once you have money you made it into more easily
#1 Korea but going global
I mean she could have global ambitions on her own doesn't need him for that
they spent 4 years mainly getting makeup or what
so many points (10, 13) where it could've ended so there's gonna be something traumatic
guanxi - social networks - it means relationship
wait director choi is him wtf can they go back to the pub
i mean wedlock isn't doing anything terrible but he should still just go to america and never show his face again
are they saying sajangnim or chairman jang
kumon, kumon -> stop, i said stop
jangga, jangga -> it's all about jangga co
the reason your life sucks is you're all trash ppl stop blaming others
obviously the gangster connection is gonna come back
what if saying keep doing nothing goads her into doing something
twisted nerd is a lesson in not holding on to revenge only
awww young chairman jang looked like his sons and was a nice guy
oh bo-hyeon was his sister
set a goal but if you stick to it and get it are you satisfied
punished by heaven? you should be punished by me
i can't believe you are the only person who wants me to stay alive/you will be my last grand show
really just hatred keeping him alive like a sith lord or what

14
did they really not go on one date in 4 years
should you have to feel sorry for someone who loves you unrequited
toni not deported :D
stress related nosebleed is that how it happens
don't go drink with wedlock
at least she can recognize when she got the life she wanted but it isn't a goal she's satisfied with
is it just skater boy?
"should still like me" why should
is there like one place to drink in itaewon or do characters in kdrama just wear magnets or something
dressed nicer in bed than i do going outside
saeroyi is going to the hospital
not using the card
"i cant wait for too long" is the old guy gonna die just to spite him
suprised mr kim is so generic but i guess you can tell from the gray suit
yeah why did she not leave her boss who she hates ah he's so evil
is he telling her to leave jangga or what
password is his name ofc oh no it's his birthday
sometimes you gotta move on tho lol
why do they even talk to wedlock after he outed hyun in
having feelings for someone your friend (and he's not even) is not even a betrayal
why for that guy tho lol
ofc he regrets letting yi seo walk away

episodic but still a long movie (hotel luna, itaewon class)

15
detective could redeem himself here?
even prison is a small world in korea
dad chose jangga is the first correct thing wedlock has said in a while
he's evil and incompetent
blood on the lip
you guys think your lives are worth nothing you morons
at least she resigns before she dies
...and she did something about it!
thus spoke zarathustra lol they picked a nice suicidal book
nice that he's reckoning with living based on hatred
would choose to live again
live in clover - is that the right idiom
swallow your pride and do it

16
"i wasted a decade" you wasted your life bitch
why cant they ever leave without turning back and saying something 
does he just keel over and die or what
i mean if he dies for her maybe he barely almost redeems himself idk
but you couldnt call the police at this point?
hajemun ? but
yiseo is so smart she can go sideways instead of getting run down by a car
that's a game of chicken
get in the fucking car and drive away nvm it's totalled BUT THE OTHER CAR ISNT WTF???
blood on the lip
how does the car stop when he throws a rock
honestly dont kill him just leave him alive to rot in prison
do something smart yiseo please
YES THE COP NOW HAHA IT'S HIS FULL CIRCLE ALL ALONG
nice to hear the end to not ending it
he got hit like 50x btw
weirdly in the end she lived more for revenge than herself
you love to see it tho "stop whining. i forgive you" and walk away
ex cop could be a bit less awkward
mr kim just says "im a salaryman" and that's it
lol her mom isnt even cute or is she angling for marriage now or what
little old grandmothers always start and wrap up the story
sponsored by big soft tofu or what
i like how he goes ahhh after he eats
"i give a lot of care to fermented soybean powder" then poetic about the soup
dont make him kneel wtf i thought you grew past that
really disagree with haivng jang kneel
the only redeeming quality is having him care about jangga co in a good way
and it's nice that he apologizes without anything to gain
why do they need this scene to have him say it doesnt feel great like he learned that already?
at least he doesnt blame yi seo
and he knew what he was doing was wrong but not how to stop
it's no okay though lol but whatever
as a friend, can you cheer for me? <- is a classy way to go
oh and she was at mr park's grave ok her story is good
lol they made toni learn english
does he apologize idk if that's enough but whatever
the punch was good though
thank god he's going to the US he should just fuck off and leave korea
i mean it's nice of her to say sorry on her own behalf but idk she can't for others
just say im happy for you and just accept it gracefully and have some tea lol
did she just say "date eo" and they translate it to "can we go out"
lol just walk in itaewon with her and that does it
would sort of redeem the skater girl narrative if he needs her to be happy because revenge wasnt it, the loved ones flashbacks are p close
im already happier than i ever imagined i could be <= there you go
usual day, night tastes? ok good ending
