development of our region
I hope things turn out well for assaulted gf
ok but the domestic violence and her husband are not the same
I bet I'll become dull about it one day since life is long
lying just makes it more painful
it looks like your emotions are unstable fuck this guy though

so they had a baby then got married
man could he just follow through without cheating on her lol
like just get a divorce if you must
who does he love, who does he choose
how can he say you know i cant live without you to her too lol
so tae oh's mom is dying and he doesn't go to care for her
does she know about her son cheating and still want the doctor to help him
"i cant imagine a life without sun woo" but he wont divorce da kyung
he loves them both
i mean sucks for you but you're married lol you don't have the right to cheat
"There's absolutely nothing to worry about" but he's texting da kyung in the middle of the night
ofc her eyes open ^^
does she have the condom already and not want to provide it
lawyer kinda callous
blind eye or do you really want a divorce ahhh
kronika - that's why
two beautiful piano kids
i like how she stops playing for a bit when he talks
i hope the girl she helped got rid of her bf for good
does da kyung know sun woo knows (ofc she has red hair btw)
ahhhh she cut herself watching them
and the husband took out a mortgage loan btw (3 yrs ago)
policy loan on son??? like life insurance wtf
hes 15k in debt yet he spent 10k at gosan department store
gotta be so hard for the kid
he has some magic intuition or what. fine for him to express his feelings he did nothing wrong
oh them fucking was just her imagination but they're actually working late
but how can he ask "are you really ok" when he's cheating on her like actually fuck him
sucks if you love two women but you could at least be honest
tae oh's mom/dad divorced
ah but tae oh's mom guilt tripping on sun woo's son
do her words kill tae oh's mom AND SHE BLAMES SUN WOO
don't make sun woo a murderer
OH THATS COLD watch as your son plummets from your deathbed THEYRE ALL SO NASTY
this is too much to watch alone i really cant
this show really hyping up 40 year old men
so her words did kill tae oh's mom
the friend who thinks tae oh doesnt deserve sun woo doesnt badmouth him at her funeral (says you guys have a point tho)
he's ruffled and drunk when rich guy comes like your mom died but still
did he give them the wrong shoes?
networking at your mom's funeral
"female divorcee sus"
leave dad alone at funeral to get fresh air nope he's out gotta get back to entertain guests
and then he do
cheating on a day like this?
the music he played to propose to her while fucking da kyung just divorce him
Sting - my one and only love
like how can you feel bad for tae oh when he actively does this
young people just look small in suits or what
is that the girl she helped spying on her own volition
how can he say sarangi

4
is the lawyer giving bad advice to pretend not to know and prep for divorce
do they just have the most unwilling sex or what
idk if im tired or if this show is just stressful
he moved the backpack
ohhh friend is here with an umbrella in kdrama language theyre rawdogging
chairman yeo is fked now that the doctor didnt facilitate rich men cheating on wives ahh (hospital's biggest donor)
chairman laugh always creepy
you're a married woman before you're a doctor
did she mean to set the chairman making da kyung move back in in motion
being nice to the divorcee <3
ye or de
"for men sex is like excretion" ok lol
but that lady put more (more sucessful?) effort into her husband
ahhh abuse bartender's abuser is back "that's too bad because im not done" is not correct unrequited love
the only way tae oh can look good is next to the physical abuser
kumowo friendlier than kamsamnida
sarangae -> me too (and da kyung hears)
the real expense of the divorce is gonna be all the wine they drink
"if im no longer attractive as a woman" in her hot jogging outfit btw 27 y/o looking 40 somethings
actually fuck abuser bf
the divorce lawyer is not helpful mentally either
komowo owo
nice help from hyuk or taking advantage
do you have to be hot to be a pilates instructor or what
is that her mom with the grandma threat
a gloomy dinner at a beautiful resteraunt
happy scenes are always in bars with good cheap korean cofort food
son, tae oh, da kyung
deliberate of sun woo to torment them but consider the terrible people she has to deal with
does she smoke with a baby - no! sad life for all the bourgeoisie
everyone should help hyun seo but did she actually get pregnant or is she just making that up to mess with da kyung
like da kyung is sad and needs sympathy maybe but still a bad person
"she's too old now" -> if there was ever a revenge cheating opportunity but still
so much care on makeup, youth
i mean he could tell his wife she looks good
"you look nice today"
the ones who cheat and the ones who get caught < what a world
did she walk past tae oh or someone in the hotel?
who knows sun woo is cheating on him
tbh if da kyung actually got rid of the baby and is breaking up even if it's only for selfish reasons im glad
she's gonna tell friend's wife they cheated wait it's blackmail to get 

5
meaningless wedding vows
sarang...
does he know she cheated on him
single friend really smiling at the new guy "isnt he pretty handsome"
all the wives waiting cars watching their husbands cheat on them
asshole whiny tone from abusers
je hyuk just wants to blackmail her into cheating too but apart from that it's a good deal
wtf is rash guy saying kill him
does she have PTSD
abuser is the biggest asshole without even redeeming qualities
oh btw sun woo has ptsd from a car accident lol
who's the guy giving her advice
tae oh sees sun woo break down and does nothing btw
at least da kyung is nice to abused bartender (or maybe condescending)
everyone vacations in jeju
you shouldnt touch other people's things oof
dignified chairman actor
sun woo really going for it
easy = slutty?
did you have to do this? yes it was you who ran away every single time
i slept with je hyuk btw

6
he's bored so he sleeps with other women
you who went on a trip with my husband's mistress, you're garbage just like me
sleep with je hyuk for revenge on everyone
sort of satisfying to see her torpedo all the assholes but not her son
hard to be supportive of tae oh and does he just want your dad's investment money
divorce lawyer paranoid af
rash guy's hair looks greasy too
he wants to make her seem insane to take the kid and bringing her personal life ahh
please let the psychiatrist be a good guy
tae oh is such a fucking scumbag
she doesn't have a mirror btw
why is she driving so fast
wait je hyuk is the rat guy from CLOY wtf
music sounds like hosts of mordor pouring forth
thats some road rage
oh they were racing to pick up their son from school
the music stops as she walks in
kinda annoyed at son but in fairness he's under a lot of stress
he betrayed you not me - not liking joon young
"you care more about work than me. It was dad who stayed with me. You were never around"
"if you go to him i'll die" is not an adult response either though
do koreans in general handle divorce well? obviously this one is catastrophic in any country but like kid visiting ppl do here idk
"you never apologized" good point
so joon young isn't dead but he might be
I mean she's hurting him by not telling him joon young's alive lol
but he's actually trying to kill her????
WOW thats a lot of blood on her face for a kdrama
and joon young walks in on the bloody mom lol but tae oh deserves a low blow
you know what tae oh if you weren't physically hurting your wife after you cheated on her you'd still have your son get fucked
"got what you want" is this it lol
watching saps my will to watch
dignified chairman good at smoothing over this stuff
feel kinda bad for da kyung in store but still
shut it and ka (out) ill pretend i dont have a daughter
oppa
oppa seppa (daddy please)
sarangae
he hit his wife lol it doesnt matter how he was set up
the abused bartender is the only good person in this whole thing i hope she ends up well
I'm pretty well respected in Seoul
"you can live with a cheater, but not with someone who's violent" I mean idk about the first part
what was the point of attacking each other so cruelly
honestly these 6 episodes are almost a complete drama
dating the psychiatrist or what
son likes phone games instead of talking to mom about tests now what trauma there must be
did je hyuk get his marriage together
everyone says they won't go to tae oh's party but will they?
again the music like the armies of hell are streaming out of cracks in the earth but it's just tae oh in a new suit and haircut
