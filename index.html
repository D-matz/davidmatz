		<p>Hi! I'm interested in people and computers.</p>
<p>I studied at the University of Chicago from 2016 to 2020, double majoring in computer science and sociology. Academically, I pursued a specialization in computer systems and a BA Thesis on gender roles in an online game. Outside the classroom, I've gotten a taste of game design as well as nonprofit community development in Chicago, and of teaching English in Korea. I've also had fun building projects, including some simply for my own curiosity. I'd love to keep doing technically involved and socially meaningful work. </p>

<p>working with two other interns</p>
</div>
		<p>	Interning at the Game Changer Chicago Design Lab, I prototyped a dating sim game intended to dissuade incoming college freshman from abusing alcohol and/or sexually harassing others. I felt a game is a more engaging alternative to the modules incoming students click through, often without paying much attention. The project entailed surverying literature, creating art, writing, character stories and dialogue, coding minigames, and actually putting the prototype together. This is a lot! Fortunately, I worked with eight other (fantastic) interns so I focused on the last two tasks, mainly working in JavaScript.</p> 
<br>
<p>To coordinate multiple teams, we held brief meetings and stuck sticky notes on the wall to organize our progress and goals. As a result of sharing recent work and expected deadlines, we ended up creating minigames based on stories, and vice versa. For example, as I was told we had a scene in a bar, I incorporated a drink mixing minigame to convey factors determining safe alcohol consumption. In the opposite direction, I wanted to create a rhythm game, which inspired others to write an arcade scene. The individual pieces were modular enough that nobody needed to know the inner workings of what others were doing, yet we were able to draw inspiration from one another’s work.</p>
<br>
	<p>I also got to play a bunch more games. Some of these were fun; others were broken and needed much more playtesting. Furthermore, I had to deal with the tension between making the sort of gameplay that would be satisfying for me personally and adapting the game to its intended audience.</p>

<p>My work at the All Stars Project of Chicago was roughly split between producing events to connect Chicagoland and provide opportunities to youth in underserved communities and the administrative side of a nonprofit.</p>
<br>
<p>In the office, I mainly helped organize people and materials for upcoming events. This was at times the more boring side. To save myself from manually updating hundreds and hundreds of people in a database of contacts from their LinkedIn information, I automated the process of looking them up and getting their information.</p>
<br>
<p>The two main programs I worked on were a talent show to develop community and an internship preparation and placement program for youth in the South and West Sides of Chicago with companies in the Loop. All Stars facilitates interactions between people from all across Chicago, including a pathway to corporations disadvantaged youth have relatively little access to. Forging this path to corporations for youth meant doing outreach in both boardrooms and neighborhoods.</p>

<p>students choosing Hangman word</p>
</div>




	<p>I quickly abandoned my initial ambitious but unrealistic ideas (what if we sang <i>Hamilton</i>?!) after my first time teaching a dozen Korean 13 year olds. I learned to create lesson plans and tune the content and difficulty of vocabulary words to my two classes of students, as one was slightly older and more advanced. I next implemented practicable exercises such as crossword puzzles, then started playing games such as hangman, rewarding victorious students with mango and pineapple chewy candies from the grocery store across from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagwon>Hagwon</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>Competitive exercises and games suit young Korean students striving to improve and be the best. By the end of the summer, I tried a game where all students stood up in a circle and passed around an eraser, and, when it was their turn, had to say an English vocabulary word or sit down. With all eyes on one of the last two remaining standing students struggling desperately to come up with a word, the rest chanted “TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN…”</p>
<br>
<p>When I gave the class the English vocabulary sheets back and told them they had one minute to study in preparation for the next round, their intense focus was gratifying both in terms of their English language learning and my growth as a teacher. Some read so intently they were literally physically quivering. When I asked for the papers back, students hid them under the table to snatch an extra ten seconds with the words. I had to stop them from writing on their own skin. I do not want kids writing on their skin, but I like that it is a conceivable idea because everyone in the classroom is wholeheartedly motivated.</p>

Outside, I try to jog regularly and enjoy playing soccer. On my computer, I mainly play <i>League</i> (and have made some <a href="https://d-matz.github.io/support">guides</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC14lHTYZu4A6KuCsuu2flWg">videos</a> if you’re interested, though they aren’t all up to date). <i>League</i> and other games like <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Undertale</i> are also the source of a lot of music I listen to. To end on a totally positive note, I recently watched <i>BoJack Horseman</i> and read <i>The Metamorphosis</i>.
