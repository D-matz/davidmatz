            <h3>Tastiest Bites of the Smorgasbord</h3>

            <p>Sometimes I see "selected" such and such and I’m like what does "selected" mean? So, to be clear, my selection criteria here is this class was cool or provocative or something to the extent that I’d enjoy discussing it. It follows I'd be happy to talk about any of these at davidmatz@uchicago.edu :)</p>

            <p>I included the instructor's name where I felt nobody else would teach the class the same. UChicago talks a lot about Rigor™ so I put a ™ on classes I felt were Rigor™. I put numbers for core sequences over multiple quarters.</p>

I felt some topics had good nuance, or at least a good direction of research, including ordering CS prerequisites and engaging students in virtual classrooms. But sometimes I felt STEM people just recently realized drawing circuits on the blackboard with your back turned to students makes for ineffective teaching, and reacted by ditching the idea of a good lecture for active learning. Taking notes in a lecture is learning actively too.</td>

Wrote an insane paper arguing Nietzsche reads <i>Mario</i> > <i>Braid</i> > <i>Problem Attic</i> as the slave revolt in morality and Mario is his redeemer. Prototyped a broken but cool post apocalyptic story game. Because everyone in class had a shared vocabulary for discussing games from readings and lectures, there were a lot of interesting blog posts. I had <a href="https://uofcmediastudies.wixsite.com/vgs2018/post/layers-of-metagaming-in-league-of-legends">one good post</a> but I'd really really really recommend checking out others like <a href="https://uofcmediastudies.wixsite.com/vgs2018/profile/peterforberg/blog-posts">Peter Forberg</a> and <a href="https://uofcmediastudies.wixsite.com/vgs2018/profile/samanthaxiao/blog-posts">Samantha Xiao</a>.

    <p>To narrow it down, I'm talking about the intersection like peanut butter and chocolate: cool on their own, but together...</p>

    <p>Let me further clarify that this is not exactly HCI or new technology for interfacing between humans and machines. That's all well and good, I'm just interested in particular ways people interact with one another, online.</p>

    <p>As an example, I'm currently writing a thesis arguing, based on survey and interview data, that players in enact gender roles in <i>League of Legends</i>, an ostensibly anonymous, online context, using meanings developed by the game's community.</p>
