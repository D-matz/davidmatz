  <h2>About</h2>
	<div id="c1" class="content">
		<p>Hi! I'm interested in people and computers.</p>
<p>I studied at the University of Chicago from 2016 to 2020, double majoring in computer science and sociology. Academically, some highlights were a specialization in computer systems and a BA Thesis on gender roles in an online game. Outside the classroom, I've gotten a taste of game design as well as nonprofit community development in Chicago, and of teaching English in Korea. I've also had fun building projects, including some simply for my own curiosity. I'd love to keep doing technically involved and socially meaningful work. </p>

Selected courses (i.e., classes I found cool enough I'd like to talk about them). I included the instructor's name if I felt nobody else would teach the class the same. UChicago talks a lot about Rigor™ so I put a ™ on classes I felt had Rigor™. I put numbers for core sequences over multiple quarters.</p>

In order to cover a lot of material, Babai assigns many "Do" exercises during lecture, which are to check your understanding rather than hand in. This frees him from the burden of explaining or grading which typically limits how much material can be taught in a course, allowing him to cover more. Also, he will fight you over where you put each upside down A and reverse E.</td>

            <td>Useful theoretical background for my BA thesis. Prototyped a broken but cool post apocalyptic story game. Because everyone in class had a shared vocabulary for discussing games from readings and lectures, there were a lot of interesting blog posts. I had <a href="https://uofcmediastudies.wixsite.com/vgs2018/post/layers-of-metagaming-in-league-of-legends">one good post</a> but I'd recommend checking out others like <a href="https://uofcmediastudies.wixsite.com/vgs2018/profile/peterforberg/blog-posts">Peter Forberg</a> and <a href="https://uofcmediastudies.wixsite.com/vgs2018/profile/samanthaxiao/blog-posts">Samantha Xiao</a>.
