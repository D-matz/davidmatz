People graduated so we aren’t a team anymore, but we used to have a UChicago League team and played vs other colleges. Having only played soloq it was interesting to play in a team environment with people I could have dinner with in person. We did pretty well overall, there was a tournament where we expected to get eliminated by a team that eventually did beat us, which was whatever, but we almost lost to the much weaker team before them which was traumatic. We lost the first game in the 3 game series but went back to the strategies that worked for us and came back, which was good because losing to the weaker team would’ve been very disappointing. Obviously losing always sucks but the team we lost to had a dedicated esports program with scholarships so whatever. Anyways, overall the team had a nice atmosphere but there was some tension around how much we should practice. One guy, who later became a coach for OpTic’s League team, wanted a lot of consistent and regimented practice and serious vod review. Another guy felt like he was playing fine and, busy with school and life and needing time to relax, didn’t want that level of practice. So there was a bit of drama but nothing that bad. I assume teams always have to deal with this sort of thing, and fortunately we eventually resolved it like civilized people. But then people graduated so I haven't been playing on a team. I've still played soloq though. Here's my guide for enchanter supports: <a href="https://d-matz.github.io/support/">https://d-matz.github.io/support/</a> unfortunately I don't always have time to play so I can't update it as the meta changes but hopefully the fundamentals will stay true.

I’ve attended Uncommon Hacks, an overnight hackathon. You make something and have a good time. My goal was just to finish a tiny but real project, because I wanted to get a feel for the development process even on a smaller scale. I was in a group that needed to figure out 3 things: A weather API, some calculations using it, and a front end page. We more or less did them all at once, which I felt like was a learning experience in terms of using React and an API but also for scheduling things. We had a real deadline because I was like I want to make something finished enough that it’s presentable, even if it isn’t insanely ambitious, because for me just going up and talking about it for a few minutes to a hundred people is already a challenge so I wanted to have something concrete I could easily talk about. Also, beyond our own project, they had some sponsoring technology they were presenting which I'd like to try when I have more time. And the whole event is really well produced in terms of scheduling, sites, food, etc.

Night Owls is Agnes Callard’s public philosophy initiative, involving debates followed by a Q&A. They have cookies so they usually get a hundredish students, but the one between her and Ben Callard on divorce was packed for reasons. There’s also a smaller discussion group that runs beforehand, reading papers in preparation for the debate, which I was in for one before Agnes Callard talked to Tyler Cowen about philosophy and economics (and their battle for your soul). I felt like it was basically an extension of UChicago discussion classes (Hum/Sosc/Civ) in terms of format and in addition to being interesting, it led to Professor Callard reaching out to me when she was later asked to do an event at the Field Museum on Being Alive. And at first I was like lol wtf could I do for this I’m not a philosophy person nope but then I thought well I could do Being Alive Online and just talk about my thesis for 7 out of 10 minutes. So I ended up giving a little talk as part of the Night of Ideas, which somehow France was organizing with the Field Museum, idk. Anyways I ended up arguing people live meaningful lives online or something like that idk but it was good.

I’ve also played a decent amount of IM soccer, which has been fun, but I’m so out of shape and I still have the habit of playing like I can run around for a while without dying which sadly is no longer the case.

    In my free time I do <b>not</b> go hiking, save the planet, travel, play chess, volunteer, draw, or do anything like that. Those things all sound great, but what I do is sit in front of my computer. I take sitting front of my computer very seriously, and would not be content jotting down a cool sounding hobby as an afterthought without going into it. So here’s some of my favorite media from various genres. I’d love to hear your thoughts about any of it, so if you like this stuff feel free (encouraged!) to email me at davidmatz@uchicago.edu
    </p>
    <h1>Books</h1>
    <h4>Posting books on goodreads or whatever has always felt pretentious to me but oh well</h4>

    <p>Parasite</p>

    <p>Concerning Hobbits</p>
    <p>Hurricane>Dear Theodosia>Wait for it>One Last Time>Battle of Yorktown (but really the whole musical is perfect and impossible to rank)</p>

            <h3>Tastiest Bites of the Smorgasbord</h3>

            <p>Sometimes I see "selected" such and such and I’m like what does "selected" mean? So, to be clear, my selection criteria here is this class was cool or provocative or something to the extent that I’d enjoy discussing it. It follows I'd be happy to talk about any of these at davidmatz@uchicago.edu :)</p>

            <p>I included the instructor's name where I felt nobody else would teach the class the same. UChicago talks a lot about Rigor™ so I put a ™ on classes I felt were Rigor™. I put numbers for core sequences over multiple quarters.</p>
